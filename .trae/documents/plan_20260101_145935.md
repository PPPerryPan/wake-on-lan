I'll modify both files to implement the requested changes:

1. **Remove unnecessary comments**: Delete the comments for WOL\_PORT and BROADCAST\_ADDRESS (lines 23-26 in both files)
2. **Rename TEST\_MACS variable**: Change `TEST_MACS` to `MAC_ADDRESSES` since it's not just for testing
3. **Update references**: Change all occurrences of `TEST_MACS` to `MAC_ADDRESSES` in the code, including in the main execution block

The changes will be applied to both files:

* `wol_unified_en-us.py` (English version)

* `wol_unified_zh-cn.py` (Chinese version)
